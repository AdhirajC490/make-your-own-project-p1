Astro Application - Phase 2

The reason why I am making such an application is simple. I want people to get a basic idea of how the solar system 
functions,afterall we are living in it. It would be a shame if we did not know how other planets are providing Earth with stability.
The problem is a simple one , most people dont know the sequence of the planets let alone something about them so thats why
I am making such an app.

I will encounter various challenges while making this project for example I will have to figure out a way to zoom in via onpress function or other functions 
for which I would have to research. I myself would also have to understand information about the planets and then find the required defeinations.
The other problem would be the application would be heavy and would take time to load so I will have to change the frames not to load all at once but only the required once.
Another problem which I doubt that no one has encountered is debugging the code various times and also looking for projects similar to this
to get an idea of how the code functions.
